# BootBase

A generic bootstrap-based app for learning React so that I don't waste time with looks.
Add components and logic to the components folder, replacing the ContentDummy component.

### To Use:

1. Install [Vite](https://vite.dev/) globally.
2. Clone the repo
3. Go to installation location and install npm modules
4. `npm run dev`
